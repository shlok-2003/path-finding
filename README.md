## ðŸš€ Features

1. **Speed Control**  
   - Choose animation speed: slow, medium, or fast.

### ðŸ§­ Pathfinding Algorithm Visualization

1. **Supported Algorithms**  
   - Dijkstra's Algorithm  
   - Depth-First Search (DFS)  
   - Breadth-First Search (BFS)

2. **Interactive Grid**  
   - Set and adjust starting and ending points dynamically.  
   - Add obstacles and walls to customize the grid for more complex scenarios.

3. **Speed Control**  
   - Adjust the animation speed to slow, medium, or fast.
