# Algorithm Visualizer

An interactive web application that visualizes sorting and pathfinding algorithms on a dynamic grid in real time. Designed to make core computer science concepts more intuitive through visual feedback and user interaction.

## üöÄ Features

### üî¢ Sorting Algorithm Visualization

1. **Dynamic Array Management**  
   - Adjust the size of the array to visualize sorting on different data scales.  
   - Regenerate the array with random values for varied testing.

2. **Speed Control**  
   - Choose animation speed: slow, medium, or fast.

3. **Supported Algorithms**  
   - Selection Sort  
   - Insertion Sort  
   - Bubble Sort  
   - Heap Sort  
   - Merge Sort  
   - Quick Sort

### üß≠ Pathfinding Algorithm Visualization

1. **Supported Algorithms**  
   - Dijkstra's Algorithm  
   - Depth-First Search (DFS)  
   - Breadth-First Search (BFS)

2. **Interactive Grid**  
   - Set and adjust starting and ending points dynamically.  
   - Add obstacles and walls to customize the grid for more complex scenarios.

3. **Speed Control**  
   - Adjust the animation speed to slow, medium, or fast.

## üîç Project Motivation

The purpose of this project was to reinforce my knowledge of **sorting** and **graph traversal algorithms** by bringing them to life through real-time visualizations. It helped me improve my **DOM manipulation**, **state management**, and **algorithmic thinking**, while making abstract DSA concepts visually engaging and easier to grasp.
